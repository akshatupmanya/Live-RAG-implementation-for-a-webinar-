It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban economy in India.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956. After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.\n",
            "\n",
            "Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city. By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing prominent even today. For its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021[update].\n",

            "Until the 19th century, Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the \"City of Pearls\", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology. The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.\n",

            "The name Hyderabad means \"Haydar's City\" or \"Lion City\", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "The city was originally called Baghnagar (\"city of gardens\"[7]), and later acquired the name Hyderabad.[7][8] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.[9][10][11]: 6 \n",

            "One popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it Bhagya-nagar (\"fortunate city\"[12]) after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal. The city would have been named Hyderabad in her honour.[11]: 6 [13]\n",

            "The discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor, a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age.[14][15] In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500 BCE.[16] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624 CE to 1075 CE.[17] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal—148 km (92 mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad.[18] The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost—later known as Golconda Fort—to defend their western region.[15]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate. This lasted until 1321, when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur, Khalji's general.[19] During this period, Khalji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi.[20] Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor. In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas—who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital.[21] In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga—200 km (124 mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan. The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.[22][23][24]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana. He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud-fort of Golconda and named the city \"Muhammad Nagar\". In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty.[18][25][26] The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591,[27][28] to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda.[29] During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city.[30] On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort.[31][32] The annexed city \"Hyderabad\" was renamed Darul Jihad (House of War),[33] whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah.[34] Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24).[35]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad. During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats.[36] In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire.[37] His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan.[38][39] Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan, to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda.[38]: 93–94  In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad.[36][40] The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam—by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast.[41]\n",

After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.[200][201] This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted.[202][203]: viii  A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana.[204] The mixing of religions has resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.[205]\n",

These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry, and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy.[222] This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, Dholak ke Geet (household songs based on local folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events.[223][224] The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.[225]\n",

650\\xa0km2 (250\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India.', \"With an average altitude of 542\\xa0m (1,778\\xa0ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the north of the city centre.\", 'According to the 2011 census of India, Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India.', 'With an output of US$74\\xa0billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban economy in India.', \"The Qutb Shahi dynasty's Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond the fortified Golconda.\", 'In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals.', 'In 1724, Asaf Jah I, the Mughal viceroy, declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty, also known as the Nizams.', 'Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis from 1769 to 1948.', 'As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947.', 'Hyderabad was annexed by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State from 1948 to 1956.', 'After the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh.', 'In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was split to form the state of Telangana, and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled to end in 2024.', 'Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India.', 'Relics of the Qutb Shahi and Nizam eras remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city.', \"By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire had declined in the Deccan, and the Nizam's patronage attracted men of letters from various parts of the world.\", 'A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation of local and migrated artisans, with painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing prominent even today.', 'For its cuisine, the city is listed as a creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO.', 'The Telugu film industry based in the city is the highest-grossing film industry in India as of 2021[update].', 'Until the 19th century, Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the \"City of Pearls\", and was the only trading centre for Golconda diamonds in the world.', \"Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain open.\", \"Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions.\", 'Since the 1990s, the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and information technology.', 'The formation of the special economic zones of Hardware Park and HITEC City, dedicated to information technology, has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.', 'The name Hyderabad means \"Haydar\\'s City\" or \"Lion City\", from haydar \\'lion\\' and ābād \\'city\\', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.', '[6]\\n\\nThe city was originally called Baghnagar (\"city of gardens\"[7]), and later acquired the name Hyderabad.', '[7][8] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.', '[9][10][11]:\\u200a6\\u200a\\n\\nOne popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it Bhagya-nagar (\"fortunate city\"[12]) after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl whom he married.', 'She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal.', 'The city would have been named Hyderabad in her honour.', '[11]:\\u200a6\\u200a[13]\\n\\nThe discovery of Megalithic burial sites and cairn circles in the suburbs of Hyderabad, in 1851 by Philip Meadows Taylor, a polymath in the service of the Nizam, had provided evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited since the Stone Age.', '[14][15] In 2008, Archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed Iron Age sites that may date from 500\\xa0BCE.', '[16] The region comprising modern Hyderabad and its surroundings was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty from 624\\xa0CE to 1075\\xa0CE.', '[17] Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, Golconda—now part of Hyderabad—came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1158, whose seat of power was at Warangal—148\\xa0km (92\\xa0mi) northeast of modern Hyderabad.', '[18] The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva (1199–1262) built a hilltop outpost—later known as Golconda Fort—to defend their western region.', '[15]\\n\\nThe Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the Khalji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate.', \"This lasted until 1321, when the Kakatiya dynasty was annexed by Malik Kafur, Khalji's general.\", '[19] During this period, Khalji took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which is said to have been mined from the Kollur Mines of Golconda, to Delhi.', '[20] Muhammad bin Tughluq succeeded to the Delhi sultanate in 1325, bringing Warangal under the rule of the Tughlaq dynasty; Malik Maqbul Tilangani was appointed its governor.', 'In 1336 the regional chieftains Musunuri Nayakas—who revolted against the Delhi sultanate in 1333—took Warangal under their direct control and declared it as their capital.', '[21] In 1347 when Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, a governor under bin Tughluq, rebelled against Delhi and established the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan Plateau, with Gulbarga—200\\xa0km (124\\xa0mi) west of Hyderabad—as its capital, both the neighbouring rulers Musunuri Nayakas of Warangal and Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga engaged in many wars until 1364–65 when a peace treaty was signed and the Musunuri Nayakas ceded Golconda Fort to the Bahmani Sultan.', 'The Bahmani Sultans ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent Muslim rulers of the Deccan.', '[22][23][24]\\n\\nIn 1496 Sultan Quli was appointed as a Bahmani governor of Telangana.', 'He rebuilt, expanded and fortified the old mud-fort of Golconda and named the city \"Muhammad Nagar\".', 'In 1518, he revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty.', '[18][25][26] The fifth Qutb Shahi sultan, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, established Hyderabad on the banks of the Musi River in 1591,[27][28] to avoid water shortages experienced at Golconda.', '[29] During his rule, he had the Charminar and Mecca Masjid built in the city.', '[30] On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda Fort.', '[31][32] The annexed city \"Hyderabad\" was renamed Darul Jihad (House of War),[33] whereas the main territories of the Golconda Sultanate were incorporated into the Mughal empire as the province Hyderabad Subah.', '[34] Mughal rule in Hyderabad was administered by three main governors: Jan Sipar Khan (1688–1700), his son Rustam Dil Khan (1700–13) and Mubariz Khan (1713–24).', '[35]\\n\\nIn 1713, Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar appointed Mubariz Khan as Governor of Hyderabad.', 'During his tenure, he fortified the city and controlled the internal and neighbouring threats.', '[36] In 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm).', 'In 1721, he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Mughal Empire.', '[37] His differences with the court nobles led him to resign from all the imperial responsibilities in 1723 and leave for Deccan.', \"[38][39] Under the influence of Asaf Jah I's opponents, Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan, to stop Asaf Jah I which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda.\", '[38]:\\u200a93–94\\u200a In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty.', 'Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad.', '[36][40] The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750–1751) and Salabat Jung (1751–1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces.', 'The accession of Asaf Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability.', 'In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam—by which the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent, got the right to control and collect the taxes at Coromandel Coast.', '[41]\\n\\nIn 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Asaf Jahi Nizams.', \"[36][40] In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore), Baji Rao I (Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), and Basalath Jung (Asaf Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by French General the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to be stationed at Bolarum (modern Secunderabad) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.\", '[41]\\n\\nUntil 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad.', 'With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar lake,[42] and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport.', 'The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj.', '[36][40]\\n\\nAfter India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union or newly formed Dominion of Pakistan.', '[41] The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948.', 'On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo.', 'With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until it was abolished on 31 October 1956.', '[40][43]\\n\\nBetween 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region.', '[44] The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital.', '[45] In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location.', '[46]\\n\\nOn 1 November 1956 the states of India were reorganised by language.', 'Hyderabad state was split into three parts, which were merged with neighbouring states to form Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.', 'The nine Telugu- and Urdu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in the Telangana region were merged with the Telugu-speaking Andhra State to create Andhra Pradesh,[47][48][49] with Hyderabad as its capital.', 'Several protests, known collectively as the Telangana movement, attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new Telangana state.', 'Major actions took place in 1969 and 1972, and a third began in 2010.', '[50] The city suffered several explosions: one at Dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives;[51] terrorist bombs in May and August 2007 caused communal tension and riots;[52] and two bombs exploded in February 2013.', '[53] On 30 July 2013 the government of India declared that part of Andhra Pradesh would be split off to form a new Telangana state and that Hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years.', 'On 3 October 2013 the Union Cabinet approved the proposal,[54] and in February 2014 both houses of Parliament passed the Telangana Bill.', 'With the final assent of the President of India, Telangana state was formed on 2 June 2014.', '[55]\\n\\nHyderabad is 1,566\\xa0km (973\\xa0mi) south of Delhi, 699\\xa0km (434\\xa0mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 570\\xa0km (350\\xa0mi) north of Bangalore by road.', '[57] It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India,[58] along the banks of the Musi River, a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India.', '[59][60][61] Greater Hyderabad covers 650\\xa0km2 (250\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India.', '[62] With an average altitude of 542\\xa0m (1,778\\xa0ft), Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite, dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at 672\\xa0m (2,205\\xa0ft).', '[61][63] The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as sagar, meaning \"sea\".', 'Examples include artificial lakes created by dams on the Musi, such as Hussain Sagar (built in 1562 near the city centre), Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar.', '[61][64] As of 1996[update], the city had 140 lakes and 834 water tanks (ponds).', '[65]\\n\\nHyderabad has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh).', '[66] The annual mean temperature is 26.6\\xa0°C (79.9\\xa0°F);
